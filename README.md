Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` template you can use for your Node.js and MongoDB backend project:

# Node.js and MongoDB Backend

This is a backend application built with **Node.js** and **MongoDB**, designed to handle user authentication and management through a simple RESTful API. It supports user signup, login, and token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This project serves as the foundation for building scalable, data-driven web applications.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login using JWT-based authentication.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores user data and other resources in MongoDB.
- **Modular Architecture**: Separated files for routes, controllers, models, and middleware for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Middleware**: Protects routes with authentication middleware for secure access control.
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration of sensitive data like database URI and JWT secret via `.env` file.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (or use a cloud-based MongoDB service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abuhuraira071/nodejs-mongodb-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd nodejs-mongodb-backend
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start, and you can access the API at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoints

- **POST `/api/signup`**: Create a new user account.
  - Request body: `{ "username": "example", "email": "user@example.com", "password": "password" }`
  
- **POST `/api/login`**: Login with an existing user.
  - Request body: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "password" }`
  
- **GET `/api/protected`**: A protected route that requires JWT authentication.
  - Include JWT token in the `Authorization` header.

### How to Customize
- Update the **MongoDB URI** and **JWT Secret** in the `.env` file.
- Add more API routes as necessary based on your app's needs.
- Modify the `README.md` to reflect any additional features or configuration steps as the project evolves.
